This repository contains my master thesis project "Testing of implicit learning of sequential motor skills".
The master thesis (Masterarbeit_GERMAN.pdf) written in german language can also be found in the main folder "Master Thesis".
The thesis contains additional information about the project, documentation to the written source code (found in Chapter Implementation) and also data evaluation of a small realised study with 15 participants.
